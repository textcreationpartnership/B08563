            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have been deſired by ſome Gentlemen, who are Well-wiſhers to the intended <hi>LAND-BANK,</hi> to publiſh my <hi>Anſwers</hi> to the following <hi>Queries,</hi> propounded by ſeveral who have read my <hi>PROPOSALS, Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Firſt,"/> 
               <hi>Where will there be Money found to Circulate the propoſed Bills of Credit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Secondly,"/> 
               <hi>If I take up Bills to the value of</hi> 1000 l <hi>or more, of the Directors, upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of my Eſtate, and theſe Bills be delivered out in Payment from one to another, How ſhall I get theſe Bills again if I have a mind to clear my Eſtate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Thirdly,"/> 
               <hi>When I have ſettled my Eſtate upon the Truſtees, How muſt I get it out of their Hands, if I would ſell it, or ſettle it for a Jointure?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Fourthly,"/> 
               <hi>If I pay at any time part of my Principal to the Directors, Whether I muſt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding continue the payment of the whole Intereſt, or be from that time diſcharged from payment of Intereſt for ſuch part of the Principal I ſhall ſo pay the Directors?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>1ſt Queſt. anſwer'd.</label> The procuring Money to anſwer theſe Bills is part of the Method which I have to lay before thoſe Directors who ſhall be choſen by the Subſcribers, which I think is not reaſonable for me to diſcover till I am in a Capacity to put it in Execution, leſt I give others an Opportunity to raiſe a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure on my Foundation, which ſome have already attempted to do.</p>
            <p>
               <label>2d Queſt. anſwer'd.</label> No Man's Eſtate is propoſed to ſtand engaged for any particular Bill or Bills of Credit, but for ſuch value only in Bills or Money as he ſhall take up or receive upon the Security of his Eſtate; and upon his payment of ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or delivering up Bills of Credit to the like value, his Eſtate will be cleared.</p>
            <p>
               <label>3d Queſt. anſwer'd.</label> Any Man may as well ſell or otherwiſe diſpoſe of his Eſtate that is ſo ſettled, as he may any mortgaged Eſtate, this being in this reſpect no other than a Mortgage, only it is ſuted more for the advantage of the Mortgager than are the uſual Mortgages: And any Man who ſettles his Eſtate in Truſt may have his <hi>Deed</hi> up again whenſoever he pleaſes, upon payment of <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>4th Queſt. anſwer'd.</label> You are to pay Intereſt for ſo much Principal as you from time to time ſhall owe to the <hi>BANK,</hi> and for no more.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of my <hi>PROPOSAL</hi> is this,</p>
            <p>That the Freeholders are only deſired to unite themſelves into a Body, by ſubſcribing their Eſtates to be a Fund for a National <hi>LAND-BANK.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no Man who ſhall ſubſcribe obliges himſelf, nor his Eſtate by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, the ſame being rather a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of the Names and Eſtates of ſuch who are willing to encourage it.</p>
            <p>And I propoſe, that when there ſhall be a Subſcription of 100000 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> the major part of the Subſcribers met together are to chooſe <hi>Truſtees</hi> on whom to ſettle their Eſtates, and <hi>Directors</hi> to manage the intended <hi>BANK.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe <hi>Directors</hi> I ſhall propoſe my Methods of raiſing Money, and till then the <hi>Subſcribers</hi> or their Eſtates are under no Obligation, nor themſelves at a Penny Charge.</p>
            <p>As my Methods ſhall be approved or diſapproved, the <hi>Subſcribers</hi> may ſettle or forbear to ſettle their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>If they ſettle their Eſtates, their Eſtates are to be chargeable for no more than what they themſelves ſhall actually receive: and the <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> if they pleaſe, ſhall be furniſh'd with three fourth parts of the Value of their Eſtates at 3 <hi>l.</hi> 0 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d. per Cent. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if they ſhall not ſettle their Eſtates, as they will not have been at the leaſt Charge, ſo they will be at no Trouble but only writing their Names, and meeting once to chooſe <hi>Truſtees, Directors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Subſcription Books lie open at the Chambers of <hi>Thomas Gooding</hi> Serjeant at Law, in <hi>Field-Court</hi> in <hi>Grayes</hi>-Inn At <hi>Philip Neave</hi> Eſq his Chambers, the ſecond Stair-caſe of the Paper-Buildings in the <hi>Inner Temple.</hi> At <hi>Lawrence Braddon</hi> Eſq his Chambers, Number 4. the ſecond Stair-Caſe in the new Square at <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inn.
